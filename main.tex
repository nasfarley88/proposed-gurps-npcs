\begin{npcdescription}
  \lettrine{L}{eslie} ``Trunchball'' Dyers is a strong woman, \emph{literally!}
  The kingpin of her own empire, Trunchball has built her bounty hunter company
  from the ground up into one of the premier bounty hunter the local area. A
  formidable force herself once, she now sits behind a desk dealing with the day
  to day of the business. She seems to take personal pleasure in chewing out
  bounty hunter employees who mess up.

  However, she is haunted by her inability to get approval from her parents. Her
  sister, the golden child, always seems to get preferential treatment no matter
  what they do despite the fact that she has disavaowed her parents. To this
  day, Trunchball is still highly motivated to gain the approval she percieves
  she has never recieved.

  When called into combat, Trunchball dons elbow length power gloves, amplifying
  her strength to well beyond human limits.

\subsection{Meta Stats}

\begin{npcdescription}
  \lettrine{N}{ecro-psi} computer hacker, \shadow\ is the man when you want
  information, but you don't want to know where it comes from.

  Presumably from a normal home, very little information is known about \shadow.
  What is known is that he has the ability to slip in and out of facilities by
  turning into a silhouette. He alwasy get sthe information he has been hired to
  get. But there is always a terrible cost, at least one person from the company
  always dies. Some say that it is \shadow\ himself, killing them so he can read
  the mind of the dead. But surely such a thing is not possible...

  % He becomes a silhouette by rotating in a curled dimension. Since light goes
  % through all dimensions, he becomes a 3D silhouette and easily blends into the
  % background. 

  Abilities include:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Silhouette] Shift into pure shadow, allowing access to areas usually
    forbidden. See \#3/99 for more details.
  \item[Garotte] Literally, a garotte
  \item[Flashes of Insight] Signature move: read the mind of a recently deceased
    sysadmin (who may or may not have come in contact with a garotte) and get
    the admin password direct from their memory. Will prefer the snapshot
    version of this ability with the penalties listed in \#3/99.
  \end{description}

  Suffice to say, you probably don't want to meet \shadow\ in a dark alley. Or
  at all. He takes payment by wire transfer and secure email.
